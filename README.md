# Analyzing Labor Market Outcomes of Humanities & Social Science College Degree Holders in the USA
---

### Project Summary
In November 2018, I was commissioned by the Office of the Senior Associate Dean of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences at George Mason Univeristy (GMU) to answer the following research questions for the university:

1. What is the median and average salary for those holding degrees offered by GMU's College of Humanities & Social Sciences (CHSS) both (a.) nationwide and (b.) in the DC metropolitan area?
2. What is the unemployment rate for those holding degrees offered by GMU CHSS both (a.) nationwide and (b.) in the DC metropolitan area?
3. What are the dominant industries that those holding degrees offered by GMU CHSS are employed in, both (a.) nationwide and (b.) in the DC metropolitan area?

### Data

The data come from IPUMS 2017 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year estimates, available at: https://usa.ipums.org/usa/index.shtml. Due to copyright and licensing, the original data are not provided in this repository but can be obtained from IPUMS directly.

The data analysis I conducted herein is now featured in an interactive web app run by the university: [Can I Get a Job?](https://chss.gmu.edu/careers/can-i-get-a-job). The included R script contains the analytic procedures followed for cleaning the data, sorting and assinging degree codes, and generating the descriptive statistics featured in the web app.
